    Global warming, also known as climate change, refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature and alterations in weather patterns caused by human activities, primarily the burning of 
    fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. The accumulation of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere leads to the trapping of heat, resulting in a range of adverse
    effects on the environment, biodiversity, and socio-economic aspects. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns disrupt ecosystems, impacting plant and animal species, leading to habitat loss, and 
    increasing the risk of species extinction. It also contributes to the degradation of natural resources like water and soil, affecting food production and availability. Moreover, global warming intensifies 
    extreme weather events, causing significant damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and human settlements, resulting in economic losses, displacement of communities, and heightened risks to human health and 
    safety. Recognizing the global nature of climate change, addressing it requires international cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, develop clean energy sources, and build resilience. By taking 
    action to mitigate global warming, we can strive towards a more equitable and sustainable future, promoting environmental stewardship and ensuring a livable planet for present and future generations. This 
    website was created to not just let you know all the latest weather updates in your area but to raise awareness of how climate change is affecting you in your area.
