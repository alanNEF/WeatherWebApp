# WeatherWebApp
### Final AP CS Project and AP Stats, Weather Web Application
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project was designed to showcase the skills I learned throughout my AP Computer Science and AP Statistics classes. My goal for this project was to combine my skills from both classes to make a joint final project with real world application. This project contains weather and location APIs used to track and find a user's location(if allowed) and give current weather data for the location. The computer science part of this project was integrating the APIs using JavaScript to provide the data and using HTML/CSS to present the data in a visually pleasing way. The AP statistics part of this project presents an accurate mathematical analysis of the data provided by the data from the APIs to show the trend line for temperatures rising in the area the user selected.
### Goals For This Project
* Integrate APIs successfully and ensure they provide accurate data (JavaScript)
* Create a working search bar that must work for all cities in the world
* Display data in a visually pleasing way (HTML/CSS)
* Calculate an analysis graph to create a visualization for climate change in the area of the user
