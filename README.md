# WeatherWebApp
Final AP CS project, weather web application
This is my final AP CSA project, this project was oriented to helping me learn more about web developement with a real world application.
Weahter apps are something very important in everyones everyday life, therefore I thought it woulf be a perfect place to start. This
web app contains a modern UI design with real active statistic of current weather data and weather history.
