# WeatherWebApp
Final AP CS project and AP Stats, weather web application
This is my final AP CSA and Stats project, this project was oriented to helping me learn more about web developement with a real world application of statistics.
Weahter apps are something very important in everyones everyday life, therefore I thought it woulf be a perfect place to start. This
web app contains a modern UI design with real active statistic of current weather data and weather history.
